      <p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my site. My name is Pranav Jain and I am a CSCE student at Texas A&M University.<p>
      <p>Since I was young, I have always loved to build stuff. In middle school, I would spend my weekends following build tutorials by Steve Spangler and Kip Kay on Youtube. In high school, I took the game design and robotics courses offered by my high school. This passion for building stuff led me to choose computer science as my major.<p>
